# Encryption-V2

A simple program that can encrype and decrypt strings and files using various encryption methods.

# Features

The program allows users to encrypt and decrypt using the ceasar and vernam ciphers as well as view the translations between plain text and encrypted text.

# In Progress

The user will be able to use RSA encryption with private and public keys.

There will be the option to use hashing algorithms that are commonly used with passwords to hash data.

THere will be educational information about different types of encryption and hashing to help people understand how data is kept securely and what is happening behind the scenes.
